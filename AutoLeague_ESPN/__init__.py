"""

The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to
prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later
(deeper) on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute
 initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.
