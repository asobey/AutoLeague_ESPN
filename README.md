# AutoLeague_ESPN
ESPN Fantasy Football Robot

After the draft, let the AutoLeague take care of your team for you. You have too much on your plate. Sit back and relax while
AutoLeague takes care of the thinking. Starting with ESPN.

Atomate_Team_Management is the main file used to handle ESPN Fantasy Football (FF) Team Management. This is meant to handle an entire season without users input.
#GOALS:
1) Set weekly line-ups (put high scorers in, take low scorers/non players out)
2) Frequent the waiver wire and pickup better players
3) Offer trades (offset to owners team)

One required file that I do not have on GitHub is the username/password keeper. Please create this file and place it in the same directory to use this program. It consists of only two lines (below) and requires your ESPN username and password.
